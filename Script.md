## Plot

Steve woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an eggs he left for school.
Normally Steve would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Steve’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Steve had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.

He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Steve would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
The zookeeper was screaming: "Get out of here you dirty hooligan!"
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Steve found a magic box that promised him magic powers.
Little did he know it was a trap.
Steve unleashed the demon of the zoo. It had the form of a panther but it had evil powers.
After days of hiding from this demon, the magic unicorn, Alan shows up and saves the day.
That is when Steve figured out he is no real and he lives in an imaginary world.
The end.
